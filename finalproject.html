                and physical harm. The term addiction does not only refer to dependence on substances such as heroin or cocaine.Addiction 
                is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and
                an individual’s life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and 
                often continue despite harmful consequences. </h2>

                • DRINKING JUST TO HAVE THE TASTE: Few teenagers and adults just drink alcoholic beverage just to know the taste for the

            <h1 class="heading"> HOW TO AVOID ALCOHOL ADDICTION </h1>
            <br>
            <h2> Think about why you drink </h2>
            <h3>Maybe your concerns center around your reasons for drinking rather than the amount.
               Plenty of people use alcohol to numb emotional pain or face stressful situations more easily.
               It’s common to drink to lighten tension on a first date or before a difficult conversation. 
               She goes on to explain that knowing the reasons behind your alcohol use — relationship stress,
                trouble at work, insomnia, or anything else — can help you explore alternative ways to address those issues more productively.
              </h3>
             <h2> Involve your loved ones</h2>
             <h3>Family and friends can provide encouragement and support when you stop drinking.
              Maybe your partner, sibling, or roommate is also thinking about making a change.
               Changing drinking habits together allows you to support each other while also boosting your motivation and accountability.
               Building new relationships with people who also choose to avoid alcohol can have a lot of benefit.
             </h3>  
             <h2> Change your enviroment </h2>
             <h3>You may not need to completely reinvent your life to quit drinking, but a few changes in your surroundings can make a big difference.
             </h3>
             <h2> Get rid of your alcohol </h2> 
             <h3> Alcohol in your house can tempt you when you’re trying to quit. 
              If you live with roommates, consider asking them to keep their alcohol out of sight instead of in shared open spaces.
            </h3>
              <h2> Vary your routine</h2>
              <h3> When you tend to drink at a certain time of day, doing something else is one of the best ways to break that pattern.
                Instead of going to your usual restaurant , try going to a new place that doesn't serve alcoho. 
                If you usually meet friends for a drink after work , try going to alcohol free spaces  
              </h3>
              <h2> Rediscover hobbies </h2>
              <h3> Satisfying hobbies can distract you from wanting to drink, but they also help you relax — something everyone needs to do.
                If you’ve recently found yourself longing to get back into an old hobby, now’s the time to go for it.
              </h3>
              <h2> Reach out for support</h2>
              <h3> If you feel comfortable doing so, bring up your challenges to your primary healthcare provider.
                 Finding a therapist can also be a great starting point if you aren’t comfortable opening up to your healthcare provider.
                 It might also be worth checking out a 12-step program in your area, like Alcoholics Anonymous or SMART Recovery,
                  to see if it feels like something that might be useful for you.</h3>
